A comparator is an interface which is present in java.util package which is used to
implement multiple custom sorting orders for objects.

We need to implement the comparator<T>.
and override the compare method and write a custom logic.

now ,
compare(T o1 , T o2)
=> return 0 => if both are equal
=> return -ve => if o1 is smaller
=> return +ve => if o1 is greater
