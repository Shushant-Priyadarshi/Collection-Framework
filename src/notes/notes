⭐️Collection:  A collection allows a group of objects treated as single unit.
               The collection framework provides the custom utility classes for
               various kinds of collections.

        ➡ It have 3 main parts:
            1️⃣Core Interfaces: The collection interface extends the iterable interface that
                                that specifies an iterator to sequentially access the element
                                of an iterable object.

            ⭐️Collection: It provides the blueprint for the basic operations that are common
                    to all collections like adding,removing and checking its existence.
            ⭐️List: An ordered collection that can contain duplicate value.
                    eg.ArrayList, LinkedList
            ⭐Set: A collection that cannot have duplicate values.
                    eg.HashSet, TreeSet
            ⭐️Queue: A collection designed to hold element prior to processing.
            ⭐Deque: A double-ended queue that allows insertion and removal from both sides
            ⭐️Map:  An interface that represents a collection of key value pairs.
                    eg.HashMap,TreeMap
