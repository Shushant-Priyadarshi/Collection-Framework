⭐️ArrayList is a resizeable array implementation of the list interface.
⭐️The dynamic array is implemented by making a new array when the current array is
  full and copying the elements to it.
⭐️The default capacity of array list is 10.
⭐️Custom capacity => ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(1000); => 1000 capacity

🏋🏻‍♀️ArrayList Working :

    1️⃣When adding:
        1)checking capacity of the array.
        2)resize if necessary approximately 1.5 larger than the previous.
        3)add the element

    2️⃣When removing:
        1)validate the index
        2)removing the elements and shift it to one position left.
        3)the size is decremented by 1.

‼️Comparator: Comparator is an interface for customizing the ordering.
